# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction project submission for the Data Science Internship at CodSoft! This project aims to predict movie ratings using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage Python programming and machine learning algorithms to predict movie ratings based on various features such as duration, genre, director, and actors. The project explores the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains machine learning models, and evaluates their performance for rating prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project : <a href = "https://github.com/kindo-tk/CODSOFT/blob/main/Movie_Rating_Prediction/IMDb%20Movies%20India.csv"> `IMDb dataset`</a>

## Conclusion
The evaluation of the linear regression model yielded promising results. The model demonstrated a relatively low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.3529 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.4431, indicating that, on average, the model's predictions were close to the actual ratings. Additionally, the R-squared (R2) score of 0.7964 indicated that approximately 79.64% of the variance in the movie ratings was explained by the model.
