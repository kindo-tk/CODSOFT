Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio at CodSoft! This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

## <a href="https://github.com/kindo-tk/CODSOFT/tree/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction">Titanic Survival Prediction </a>

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

## <a href = "https://github.com/kindo-tk/CODSOFT/tree/main/Movie_Rating_Prediction">Movie Rating Prediction with Python</a>

**Description:** In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine-learning model to predict movie ratings.

## Iris Flower Classification

**Description:** The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine-learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Sales Prediction using Python

**Description:** This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model to forecast future sales.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Description:** In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.

Each project folder contains detailed documentation and code files showcasing the analysis, methodology, and results.
