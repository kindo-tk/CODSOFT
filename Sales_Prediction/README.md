# SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Welcome to the Sales Prediction project submission for the Data Science Internship at `CodSoft`! 

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of different advertising channels on sales. By utilizing linear regression models, we assess the effectiveness of TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements and provide insights on how to optimize advertising spend for maximizing sales.


## Dataset
The <a href = "https://github.com/kindo-tk/CODSOFT/blob/main/Sales_Prediction/advertising.csv">`dataset`</a> includes the following columns:
- `TV`: Money spent on TV advertising.
- `Radio`: Money spent on radio advertising.
- `Newspaper`: Money spent on newspaper advertising.
- `Sales`: Sales generated.


## Key Findings
1. **Model Accuracy**:
   - The model explains 91.4% of the variability in the training data and 87.3% in the test data.
   - MAE and MSE values indicate good prediction accuracy with slightly higher errors on the test data.

2. **Impact of Advertising Channels**:
   - **TV Advertising**: Highest impact on sales, making it the most effective channel.
   - **Radio Advertising**: Provides stable returns with less risk.
   - **Newspaper Advertising**: Lower impact on sales, suggesting less effectiveness compared to TV and radio.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Increase investment in TV advertising for maximum impact.
   - Maintain stable investment in radio advertising for consistent returns.
   - Reevaluate newspaper advertising strategy and consider reallocating budget to more effective channels.


## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of how different advertising channels affect sales. By leveraging data science techniques, we offer actionable insights to optimize advertising spend and drive better business outcomes.
